V1:
Priorities #1:
1. Display Map with pins
  Map has legend for pins - yellow = assault, red = death
2. Display Article View (most recent 25)
3. Admin - Add Article
  3a. Google Maps autocomplete for Location field
4. Map/Article views look nicely designed, Admin views can just use MaterialUI or SemanticUI
5. Split screen functionality
  on load:map on left, articles on right
  bar/arrow button in the middle to expand map to full screen, bar to move to the right, arrow button changes direction   

Next #2:  
1. Admin can edit or delete own article. Superadmin can edit or delete any
2. Article View - how to handle next 25 - scroll fetch?
3. When user clicks on pin on map, modal pops up with articles for that location. Hides article view.
4. Team Page - for our dev team & editor contributers

Final #3:
1. Google Analytics to track if people are visiting the site, location, do users come back


V2: Mine data off social media or grab from AAPI database


IL 3/30 Goal: Set up basic views
4/3: Set up redux flow, get 3 mock articles to render
4/1: Split screen view - article on left, get map to render, get pins to display

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
